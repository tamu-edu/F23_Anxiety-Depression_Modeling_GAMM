Pipeline for GAMM
1. Average left and right pupil dilation
2. Lienar interpolation of blinks
2. Median filter (baseline-correction is optional in GAMM modeling (see 1.

1. Downsample the data

What is GAMM-- an extension of regression; estimates the relation between a dependent variable and a number of given predictors. Instead of forcing the relation between dependent variable and predictor to be linear, as is the case in typical linear regression, this relation is modeled as a smooth function

```{r sample data}
load(file='/Users/juanbalcazar/Downloads/pupil_S2_alignPronoun.rda')
```

## GAMM with mixed effects-- treat the participant as a variable quantity

```{r GAMM model, echo=FALSE}
model <- bam(Pupil ~ Condition + 
               s(Time, by = Condition, k =20)
             + s(Time, Subject, bs = 'fs', m =1)
             +s(Time, Item = bs ='fs', m =1)
             , data = dat, discrete = TRUE)
#factor smooths specified with 'fs'
#thus random smooths for Subjects and Items
```

#test for significance

1. visual inspection of the modelâ€™s estimates of the differences between the conditions
2. a model-comparison procedure
3. inspection of the model summary statistics to determine the differences between conditions. 

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
